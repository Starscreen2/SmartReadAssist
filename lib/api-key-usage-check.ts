// This is a utility file to check if all AI features are using the key rotation mechanism

// All AI features in this application should use the getNextApiKey() function from api-key-manager.ts
// The following files have been verified to be using the key rotation mechanism:
// 1. app/actions/gemini.ts - Used by AI Assistant for chat and text highlighting
// 2. app/actions/summarize.ts - Used for document summarization
// 3. app/actions/rewrite-document.ts - Used for document rewriting

// No other files in the application should be making direct API calls to Gemini
// If you add new AI features, make sure to use the getNextApiKey() function
